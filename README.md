# House-prediction-Model
This is a house prediction model used to predict the value of house in Washington based on the sqft living area, sqft lot, zipcode, latitude , longitude, view of that area, number of bedrooms and bathrooms and many more. 
We try to fit the model using various feature tranformation and feature generation techniques.
I tried to fit the model using Linear Regression (Backward eliminatiion and forward selection ) and Decision tree seeing which is better on the train data set and then seeing the accracy on the test data set.
